# FPGA_1GE_Card
This is a Gigabit Ethernet transceiver with GPIO interface. It provides network data transfer at up to 1 Gbps with the host board via 3.3V GPIO. In addition, it is a fully integrated Ethernet solution that enables rapid project implementation, reducing development time and allowing you to focus on the core functions of the system.
